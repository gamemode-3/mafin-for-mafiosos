# Definition
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Sets|sets]]. Every $R \subset X \times Y$ is a ___relation___ over $X$ and $Y$.

A relation $R \subset X^2$ is called a relation on $X$.

If $R$ is a relation on $X$, $R^{-1}$ on $X$ is $\{(n, m) : (m, n) \in R\}$.

Let $R$ be a relation over $X$ and $Y$. Let $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.
We say that $x \in X$ is related to $y \in Y$ if $(x, y) \in R$.
This can be denoted as $x R y$.
