# Definition
Any ___order relation___, or simply ___order___ on $X$, is a [[Transitivity of a Relation|transitive]] [[Relation|relation]] on a set $X$. 
## ___Strictness___ of an order
- If it is [[Reflexivity of a Relation|reflexive]] and  [[Antisymmetry of a Relation|antisymmetric]], the relation is a [[Non-Strict Order|non-strict]] order.
- If it is [[Asymmetry of a Relation|asymmetric]], it is a [[Strict Order|strict]] order.
An order is always strict or non-strict. A relation that does not fulfill either is not an order.
## ___Totality___ / ___partiality___ of an order $\preceq$ on $X$
- If $x \preceq y$ or $y \preceq x$ for all $x, y \in X$, then $\preceq$ is [[Total Order|total]].
- Otherwise, $\preceq$ is [[Partial Order|partial]].
