# Definition
A ___strict___ [[Order Relations|order]] on $X$ is a [[Transitivity of Relations|transitive]] and [[Asymmetry of Relations|asymmetric]] [[Relations|relation]] on a [[Sets|set]] $X$.
# Implications
If an order is strict, two objects are never "equal".
You can never get $x \preceq y$ AND $y\ \preceq x$.
In other words, between two comparable elements, one is always ordered before or after the other.
# Examples
- "$<$" is a strict order on $\mathbb{R}$ because: 
	- if $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$ (transitivity)
	- if $x < y$, then $y \not < x$ (asymmetry)
