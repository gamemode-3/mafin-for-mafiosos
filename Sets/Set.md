# Definition
Collection of mathematical objects that we call ___elements___. 
If $X$ is a set, $x \in X$ denotes that $x$ is an element of $X$ and $x \notin X$ denotes that it is not.
# Notation:
The set containing a, b and c: $\{a, b, c\}$
The empty set: $\emptyset = \{\}$
The set of all natural numbers: $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$
The set of all natural numbers and 0: $\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, ...\}$ 
The set of all integers: $\mathbb{Z} = \{0, -1, 1, -2, 2, ...\}$
The set of all rational numbers: $\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{m}{n} : m \in \mathbb{Z}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$
The set of all real numbers: $\mathbb{R}$
A set of all elements from $X$ for which the conditions $c_0, c_1, ..., c_n$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$, are fulfilled: $\{x \in X: c_0, c_1, ..., c_n\}$
