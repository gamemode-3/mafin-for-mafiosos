# Definition
Any [[Mappings over Sets|mapping]] $f: X \to Y$ is ___surjective___ if for each $y \in Y$ there exists an $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.

We call a surjective mapping a ___surjection___
# Implications
In a surjective mapping $f: X \to Y$, each $y \in Y$ has at least one [[Preimage of y in a Mapping|preimage]]
