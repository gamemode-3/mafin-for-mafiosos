# Definition
Any [[Set Mapping|mapping]] $f: X \to Y$ is ___bijective___ if it is both [[Injectivity of a Mapping|injective]] and [[Surjectivity of a Mapping|surjective]].

We call a bijective mapping a ___bijection___.
# Implications
In a bijective mapping $f: X \to Y$, each $y \in Y$ has exactly one [[Preimage of y in a Mapping|preimage]]
