# Overview
A [[Mappings over Sets|mapping]] $f: X \to Y$ is
- [[Injectivity of a Mapping|injective]] if $x_1, x_2 \in X$, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies that $x_1 = x_2$
- [[Surjectivity of a Mapping|surjective]] if for each $y \in Y$ there exists an $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$
- [[Bijectivity of a Mapping|bijective]] if it is both [[Injectivity of a Mapping|injective]] and [[Surjectivity of a Mapping|surjective]]
