# Definition
A [[Mappings over Sets|mapping]] $f: X \to Y$ is ___injective___ if $x_1, x_2 \in X$, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies that $x_1 = x_2$.

We call a injective mapping an ___injection___
# Implications
In an injective mapping $f: X \to Y$, every $x \in X$ has at most one [[Preimage of y in a Mapping|preimage]]
