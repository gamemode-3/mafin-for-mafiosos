# Definition
A [[Set|set]] is ___countable___ if it is either [[Finiteness|finite]] or [[Countable Infinity|countably infinite]].

# Laws about Countablility
- If $M$ and $N$ are countable then so is $M \times N$[^1].
- If $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and each $M_n$ is a countable set then $M := \bigcup\limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} M_n$[^2] is also countable.
