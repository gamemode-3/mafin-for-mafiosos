# Definition
Let $N_{p} = \set{n \in \mathbb{N} : n \leq p}$ for some $p \in \mathbb{N}$. A [[Set|set]] $M$ is ___finite___ if there exists a $p$ such that $M \sim N_p$ ([[Equipotence]])

In this we say $M$ is of [[Cardinality|cardinality]] $p$ and we write $|M| = p$
# Infinities
A set is [[Countable Infinity|countably infinite]] if $M \sim \mathbb{N}$
A set is [[Uncountable Infinity|uncountably infinite]] if $M \sim \mathbb{R}$
