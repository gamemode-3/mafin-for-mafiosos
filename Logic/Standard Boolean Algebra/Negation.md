# In [[Propositional Calculus]]
In propositional calculus the negation of a [[Proposition|proposition]] $p$ can be thought of as the _denial_ of $p$.
# In Programming
In most programming languages like C, C#, C++, Java, Rust, JavaScript etc. the negation of a variable `a` is denoted as `!a`.
A notable exception is Python where the exclamation mark operator negates the given value [[Bitwise Operation|bitwise]] while for logical negation the keyword `not` is most commonly used.
