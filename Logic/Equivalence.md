# Definition
The ___equivalence___ of two [[Logical Expression|logical expressions]] $P$ and $Q$, denoted $P \leftrightarrow Q$, is true or $1$, if and only if for any [[Variable Assignment|variable assignment]] $P$ and $Q$ never evaluate to different truth values. 
# Implications
Let $P$ and $Q$ be equivalent expressions:
- If and only if $P$ is true then $Q$ is true, otherwise $Q$ is false.
- If and only if $P$ is $1$ then $Q$ is $1$, otherwise $Q$ is $0$.
