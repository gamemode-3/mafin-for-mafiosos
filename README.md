my notes from all maths for computer science lectures up until now

## how to view
### manually download
- click "Code" then "Download zip" and extract the zip file to a folder
- open [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and open the folder as a vault.
### automatically download (linux)
- download [notes-updater.sh](https://github.com/gamemode-3/mafin-for-mafiosos/releases/download/v1.0.0/notes-updater.sh)
#### graphical way
- "allow executing file as program" from your file manager (right click -> properties -> permissions)
- double click the file, if that doesn't work right click and select "run as a program"
#### terminal way
in the directory you put the file in (you can probably just do `cd ~/Downloads`):
```
chmod +x refresh.sh
./notes-updater.sh
```
